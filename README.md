If you're curious about our workflow and how we make all of this possible, feel free to look through our [Jira](https://compclub.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/JOB/boards/28) and [Confluence](https://compclub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JOB/overview?homepageId=2142864757) workspaces. If there's a missing feature you would like to see, please submit a suggestion through this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qvWWyWX5TdjPi2vOndxmqLJ8_5iEMahLTBu_QyJhdFc/edit?usp=sharing) or even better, contribute to the project yourself by opening an issue and making a pull request.

## Team

Jobs Board was made with ü§ç by CSE students, for CSE students. Jobsboard is a team that is part of CSESoc Projects! See [TEAM.md](./TEAM.md) for more details on the teams that contributed to the development of Jobsboard!

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- (Recommended) Database IDE like [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) (Free for students)

### Setting Up

1. Clone the jobs-board repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/csesoc/jobsboard.git
    ```
2. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
3. Set up the neccessary environment variables
   - **Frontend** (optional):
      Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory with the following contents:
       ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/
        ```
        The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is used as the base URL for any API requests made by the frontend. If you have the backend running locally, it should use the your local backend instead (http://localhost:8080/). If the backend is not running locally or if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is not provided, `https://jobsboard.staging.csesoc.unsw.edu.au/api` will be used as the base URL as a fallback option.
    - **Backend**:
      Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following contents:
         ```
          NODE_ENV=development
          SERVER_PORT=8080
          DB_HOST=localhost
          DB_PORT=5432
          DB_USER=postgres
          DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
          DB_NAME=postgres
          MAIL_USERNAME=test@gmail.com
          MAIL_PASSWORD=password
          MAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
          MAIL_SMTP_SERVER_PORT=465
         ```
      > If having `DB_HOST=localhost` result in errors such as `ECONREFUSED`, change it to `DB_HOST=db`.
4. Navigate to the `frontend` and `backend` directories and install the required dependencies by running `yarn`

<br />

### Running the frontend locally
1. Start up the frontend by navigating to the `frontend` directory and running `yarn dev`

2. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser to see the frontend running locally!


### Running the backend locally
**Without Docker**
1. After installing PostgreSQL on your computer, open a terminal and run `psql`. Now, you should see a command prompt that may look like this `matthewliu=#`.
2. Create a new database called `postgres` by running `create database postgres;` In the future, you can log straight into this database by running `psql -U postgres` in your terminal.
3. Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `yarn serve` to start up the server.

**With Docker**
1. After installing Docker on your computer, open a terminal and run `docker compose build` to build all the containers required for Jobsboard. In the future, you will only need to run either `docker compose build api` or `docker compose build test` as you make changes to them.
2. Start up the database by running `docker compose -d db` in your terminal.
3. Start up the server by following step of above or run `docker compose up` in your terminal.
> Refer to the [Using Docker](#Using-Docker) section below if you need more assisstance.

<br />

Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) on your browser to see the backend running locally!

**API Documentation**
After the server is started, you can access the API documentation at [localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs).
When adding, modifying or removing routes from `backend/src/index.ts`, please remember to update the documentation at `backend/src/docs/openapi.json` accordingly to by following the existing format.


<br />

### Running the backend in production mode

> Only use this section if you are working on a function that needs the mail queue initialised. This assumes that you are using Gmail as the test account when trying to send emails.

1. Ensure that your 2-FA for Gmail is enabled.

2. Generate an App Password by following [this](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) (Focus on the ‚ÄúCreate & Use App Passwords‚Äù section).

3. Navigate to the `docker-compose.yml` file and add this in under the api environment:
```
NODE_ENV=production
SERVER_PORT=8080
JOBS_BOARD_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
MAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_SMTP_SERVER_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=<REPLACE WITH YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<REPLACE WITH YOUR APP PASSWORD FROM STEP 2>
```

4. For the frontend, ensure you set the environment variable in `frontend/.env` to use `http://localhost:8080/`

5. Navigate to `mail.ts` and modify the `secure` field in the `transportOptions` object config to `true` as shown below:
```
const transportOptions = {
  host: process.env.MAIL_SMTP_SERVER,
  port: parseInt(process.env.MAIL_SMTP_SERVER_PORT, 10),
  secure: true, // SET THIS TO TRUE
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MAIL_USERNAME,
    pass: process.env.MAIL_PASSWORD,
  },
  requireTLS: true,
};
```

<br />

### Using Docker
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run `docker-compose build` to build all containers or `docker-compose build [container-name]` for a specific container specified in the compose file.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start all containers or `docker-compose up [container-name]` for starting a specific container specified in the compose file.
    > To view which containers you would like to build/start, refer to [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)

<br />

### Running tests

#### Frontend
*We do not have tests yet... :(*

#### Backend
**Without Docker**
1. Go to `backend/tests/config.js` and set `apiUrl` to `http://localhost:8080`. If this is your first time, run `git update-index --skip-worktree tests/config.js` to prevent git from tracking this file in the future.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the following commands in your terminal
    ```
    yarn serve
    yarn test
    ```


**With Docker**
Navigate to the root directory and run the following commands in your terminal
  ```
  docker compose build api
  docker compose build test
  docker compose up test
  ```

> Make sure to stop the server and db before rerunning the tests either using the the Docker Desktop GUI or by running `docker stop jobs-board_api_1` and `docker stop jobs-board_db_1` in your terminal.

> Use the logs in the terminal or the Docker Desktop GUI to check your tests.


The reason docker is used when testing is because we're given a guarantee that the conditions are exactly the same every time and because it emulates what the behaviour will be on prod running in the container - which there are difference.

<br />

### Code Style & Linting
#### Frontend

Coming

#### Backend
- Run `yarn run lint` to see both style and linting issues in `.ts` files within the `backend` directory at once
- Run `yarn run lint:fix` to automatically amend all style and linting issues that would be identified by running the first command **(recommended)**
- Run `yarn run prettier` to see all style issues in `.ts` files within the `backend` directory according to the prettier configuration file `.prettierrc`
- Run `yarn run prettier:fix` to automatically amend all the style issues identified by running `npm run prettier` **(recommended)**


</br >

### Finished your work
Always double check before submitting your pr
1. Run `docker compose build` and ensure the build completes successfully
2. Run `docker compose up` and ensure all tests pass

</br >

### Pushing
Log in to your preferred container registry via command line and run `docker-compose push`, ensure that they've finished pushing and then deploy where required.
