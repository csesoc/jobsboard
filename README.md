## Team

Jobs Board was made with ü§ç by CSE students, for CSE students. Jobsboard is a team that is part of CSESoc Projects! See [TEAM.md](./TEAM.md) for more details on the teams that contributed to the development of Jobsboard!

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Setting Up

1. Clone the jobs-board repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/csesoc/jobsboard.git
```
2. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Running the frontend locally
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies
```
cd frontend
yarn
```

2. (optional) Set up the required environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the following contents:
```
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/
```

The environment variable `API_BASE_URL` is used as the base URL for any API requests made by the frontend. If you have the backend running locally, it should use the your local backend instead (http://localhost:8080/). If the backend is not running locally or if `API_BASE_URL` is not provided, `https://jobsboard.staging.csesoc.unsw.edu.au/api` will be used as the base URL as a fallback option.

3. Start up the frontend
```
yarn dev
```

4. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see the frontend running locally!

### Running the backend locally
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required dependencies
```
cd backend
yarn
```

2. Set up the required environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following contents:
```
NODE_ENV=development
SERVER_PORT=8080
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
DB_NAME=postgres
```

3. Build the database docker container and start it via docker.
```
docker compose build db
docker compose up -d db
```

4. Start up the backend
```
yarn serve
```

5. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see the backend running locally! Visit [localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs) to see the API docs.

### Running the backend in production mode

> Only use this section if you are working on a function that needs the mail queue initialised. This assumes that you are using Gmail as the test account when trying to send emails.

1. Ensure that your 2-FA for Gmail is enabled.

2. Generate an App Password by following [this](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) (Focus on the ‚ÄúCreate & Use App Passwords‚Äù section).

3. Navigate to the `docker-compose.yml` file and add this in under the api environment:
```
NODE_ENV=production
SERVER_PORT=8080
JOBS_BOARD_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
MAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_SMTP_SERVER_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=<REPLACE WITH YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<REPLACE WITH YOUR APP PASSWORD FROM STEP 2>
```

4. For the frontend, ensure you set the environment variable in `frontend/.env` to use `http://localhost:8080/`

5. Navigate to `mail.ts` and modify the `secure` field in the `transportOptions` object config to `true` as shown below:
```
const transportOptions = {
  host: process.env.MAIL_SMTP_SERVER,
  port: parseInt(process.env.MAIL_SMTP_SERVER_PORT, 10),
  secure: true, // SET THIS TO TRUE
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MAIL_USERNAME,
    pass: process.env.MAIL_PASSWORD,
  },
  requireTLS: true,
};
```


### Using Docker
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run `docker-compose build` to build all containers or `docker-compose build [container-name]` for a specific container specified in the compose file.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start all containers or `docker-compose up [container-name]` for starting a specific container specified in the compose file.

> To view which containers you would like to build/start, refer to [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)

## Documentation

### Running tests

#### Frontend
*We do not have tests yet... :(*

####  Backend Testing
1. Navigate into the `/backend` folder
2. Run `docker compose build test`
3. Run `docker compose up test`

>  Use the logs in the terminal or the Docker Desktop GUI to check your tests.

> The reason docker is used when testing is because we're given a guarantee that the conditions are exactly the same every time and because it emulates what the behaviour will be on prod running in the container - which there are difference

### Finished your work
Always double check before submitting your pr
1. Run `docker compose build` and ensure the build completes successfully
2. Run `docker compose up` and ensure all tests pass

### Pushing
Log in to your preferred container registry via command line and run `docker-compose push`, ensure that they've finished pushing and then deploy where required.

### API Docs
After the api container is started, Swagger visualisation of the APIs can be accessed at [API docs](http://localhost:8080/docs/).
When adding, modifying or removing routes from `backend/src/index.ts`, update the documentation at `backend/src/docs/openapi.json` accordingly to by following the existing format.

### Code Style & Linting
#### Frontend

Coming

#### Backend
- Run `yarn run lint` to see both style and linting issues in `.ts` files within the `backend` directory at once
- Run `yarn run lint:fix` to automatically amend all style and linting issues that would be identified by running the first command **(recommended)**
- Run `yarn run prettier` to see all style issues in `.ts` files within the `backend` directory according to the prettier configuration file `.prettierrc`
- Run `yarn run prettier:fix` to automatically amend all the style issues identified by running `npm run prettier` **(recommended)**
